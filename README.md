>This is my second iOS Application Project from Boost Camp.

MemeMe is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. 
After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user can share with others.

## Contents

- **EditorController** - consists of an image view and two text fields. User pick photo from the camera or existing photo album.

- **TableController** and **CollectionController** - displays recently sent memes. User can delete selected image in Table View Controller.

- **DetailController** - displays the selected meme in an image view in the center of the page with the memeâ€™s original image. User can edit the selected memed image as well.
